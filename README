This is an 'forked' example application demonstrating Authlogic running on Rails 3.

== Features

* Registration
* Login
* Forgot password
* Email activation

It uses the email to login, you could also use a login field, if you like. I use a custom email validator (blatantly stolen from Ryan Bates) to validate email formats.

It also includes RSpec tests for the Authlogic controller.

To run the app:
bundle install
rake db:migrate
rails s
open http://localhost:3000/users/new

The root directory redirects to the login page.

To run the tests:
bundle install
rake db:migrate
rake db:test:prepare
rake

You can also run autotest for continual testing.

The version of Authlogic used here is a fork that is at:
git://github.com/odorcicd/authlogic.git branch 'rails3'

I am using this because I got a "to_key" error with the official repo.
